    ## Learning-rate Equalized Weights Parameter

    This is based on equalized learning rate introduced in the Progressive GAN paper.
    Instead of initializing weights at $\mathcal{N}(0,c)$ they initialize weights
    to $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and then multiply them by $c$ when using it.
    $$w_i = c \hat{w}_i$$

    The gradients on stored parameters $\hat{w}$ get multiplied by $c$ but this doesn't have
    an affect since optimizers such as Adam normalize them by a running mean of the squared gradients.

    The optimizer updates on $\hat{w}$ are proportionate to the learning rate $\lambda$.
    But the effective weights $w$ get updated proportionately to $c \lambda$.
    Without equalized learning rate, the effective weights will get updated proportionately to just $\lambda$.

    So we are effectively scaling the learning rate by $c$ for these weight parameters.
